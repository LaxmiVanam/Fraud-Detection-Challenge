# Fraud-Detection-Challenge

This is a classification problem based on the dataset provided by TalkingData, China’s largest independent big data service platform.

This company focuses on mobile app analytics and handles around 3 billion mobile ad clicks per day, of which 90% are potentially fraudulent. The  goal here is to analyze user’s click across their portfolio, and flag IP addresses who produce lots of clicks, but never end up installing their app. With this information, they  would like to build an IP blacklist and device blacklist from the fraudulent clicks.
